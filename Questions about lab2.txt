Q4
Cell padding is the space between the cell edges and the cell content.

th, td {
  padding: 15px;
}
VS

th, td {
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-bottom: 20px;
  padding-left: 30px;
  padding-right: 40px;
}

Cell spacing is the space between each cell.
table {
  border-spacing: 30px;
}



size:

Valid for email, password, tel, url, and text, 
the size attribute specifies how much of the input is shown. 
Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. 
The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text, 
it is a number of characters (or em units) with a default value of 20, and for others, 
it is pixels (or px units). 
CSS width takes precedence over the size attribute.
